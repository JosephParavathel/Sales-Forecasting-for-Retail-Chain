# Sales-Forecasting-for-Retail-Chain

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the sales of products across stores of a large retail chain in India. The objective is to create an accurate forecasting system that can assist organizations in planning for the future, making informed decisions, and improving overall performance.

## Project Overview

- The retail chain operates stores in Maharashtra, Telangana, and Kerala, stocking products across various categories such as FMCG, Drinks and Foods, and others.
- The dataset used contains historical sales data for different products across stores.
- Exploratory data analysis will be performed to gain insights into the data, identify patterns, and understand trends.
- Data preprocessing steps, including cleaning, transforming, and encoding, will be applied to prepare the data for model training.
- The dataset will be split into training and testing sets.
- Various forecasting techniques will be explored, with a focus on time series forecasting using models such as ARIMA and FBProphet.
- Model selection will be based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- The final model will be used to make predictions on the sales of products across stores for one month.
- These predictions can be utilized to optimize inventory management and maximize revenue for the retail chain.

## Skills and Tools Used

- Python programming language
- Data manipulation and analysis using NumPy and Pandas
- Time series forecasting models (ARIMA, FBProphet)

## Project Benefits

- Improved decision-making: Accurate sales predictions enable organizations to make informed decisions regarding inventory management, resource allocation, and strategic planning.
- Cost reduction: Optimized inventory management minimizes the risk of overstocking or stockouts, leading to cost savings.
- Competitive advantage: Accurate sales forecasting provides a competitive edge by enabling the retail chain to stay ahead of market trends and customer demands.

## Project Objectives

- Learn and apply forecasting models such as ARIMA and FbProphet.
- Gain proficiency in Python libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Statsmodels, and Prophet.
- Understand the practical implementation of forecasting models in real-world scenarios, particularly in the retail industry.

Through this project, I enhanced my skills in data analysis, forecasting, and machine learning while contributing to the optimization efforts of the retail industry.
